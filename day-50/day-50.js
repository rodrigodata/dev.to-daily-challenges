/**
 *
 * Challenge 50
 *
 * Given a phone number of integer length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10) as
 * a number string (e.g. 555-555-5555 would be passed as "5555555555"),
 * return an array of all phone numbers as
 * number strings that would be considered neighbors of that
 * phone number (which is any numbers ±1).
 *
 * Example:
 * Someone with the phone number 555-555-5555 has
 * neighbors 555-555-5554 and 555-555-5556.
